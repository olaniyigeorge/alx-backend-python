# Objective: to use a generator to compute a memory-efficient aggregate function i.e average age for a large dataset

# Instruction:

# Implement a generator stream_user_ages() that yields user ages one by one.

# Use the generator in a different function to calculate the average age without loading the entire dataset into memory

# Your script should print Average age of users: average age

# You must use no more than two loops in your script

# You are not allowed to use the SQL AVERAGE
